title: Rendering Components On A Background Runtime
---

Mount a top-level component inside `OnRuntime`. Metro treats the direct child component as a threaded boundary.

```tsx
import { OnRuntime } from '@react-native-runtimes/core';

type MessageListProps = {
  conversationId: string;
  initialIndex?: number;
};

function MessageList(props: MessageListProps) {
  return <ActualMessageList {...props} />;
}

export function ConversationPreview() {
  return (
    <OnRuntime name="messages-runtime">
      <MessageList conversationId="release-room" initialIndex={120} />
    </OnRuntime>
  );
}
```

Metro sees `MessageList` as the direct child of `OnRuntime`, rewrites it into the same registration shape as `threadedComponent(...)`, gives it a stable file-based id, and exports it so the generated threaded runtime entry can load it with `require(file).MessageList`.

`OnRuntime` renders a native `ThreadedRuntimeSurface`. The surface asks the named runtime to render `ThreadedRuntimeHost`, and that host resolves the registered component by name.

## Rules

- The `OnRuntime` child must be a direct component reference, such as `<MessageList />`.
- The child component must be defined at module top level.
- Keep the component in module/global scope so Metro can generate the registration and the other runtime can require it by name.
- Props must be JSON-serializable. Pass ids, keys, or small snapshots; read large or mutable data through a shared native store.
- `OnRuntime` accepts one threaded component child.
- Because Metro rewrites the function into an exported const, define it before code that calls it during module initialization.

## Whole Screens

For a whole route, use `ThreadedScreen`. It applies a full-size surface style and preloads the runtime by default.

```tsx
import { ThreadedScreen, threadedComponent } from '@react-native-runtimes/core';

type ConversationScreenProps = {
  conversationId: string;
};

export const ConversationScreen = threadedComponent<ConversationScreenProps>(
  'ConversationScreen',
  function ConversationScreen({ conversationId }) {
    return <ConversationRoute conversationId={conversationId} />;
  },
);

<ThreadedScreen
  component={ConversationScreen}
  props={{ conversationId: 'release-room' }}
  runtimeName="conversation-release-room-runtime"
  testID="conversation-threaded-screen"
/>;
```

Keep runtime names stable. If the name changes, native creates or switches to another runtime.

## Explicit Registration

Use `threadedComponent` directly when you want to provide a custom component name or avoid the directive transform.

```tsx
import { Threaded, threadedComponent } from '@react-native-runtimes/core';

export const MessageList = threadedComponent<MessageListProps>(
  'MessageList',
  function MessageList(props) {
    return <ActualMessageList {...props} />;
  },
);

<Threaded
  component={MessageList}
  props={{ conversationId: 'release-room', initialIndex: 120 }}
  runtimeName="messages-runtime"
/>;
```

## When To Use It

- Long chat or feed screens.
- Heavy list renderers such as FlashList or LegendList.
- Components that can keep working while the main JS runtime is blocked.
- Screens where native navigation should stay responsive even when the screen's JS work is busy.
