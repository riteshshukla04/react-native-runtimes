title: Background Thread Architecture
---

Use two JavaScript runtimes for app-lifetime background work:

- `main` renders UI and handles user interaction.
- `background` stays warm and owns sync, caching, queues, parsing, and other
  non-visual work.

The recommended setup is native prewarm plus shared Zustand state. Schedule
functions with a fixed-runtime directive when a function belongs to only one
runtime.

## Native Prewarm

Start the background runtime from native app startup. This keeps the runtime
alive before React screens ask it to do work.

Android:

```kotlin
import com.facebook.react.PackageList
import com.nativecompose.threadedruntime.ThreadedRuntime

class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    ThreadedRuntime.setMainReactPackagesProvider {
      PackageList(this).packages
    }

    loadReactNative(this)
    ThreadedRuntime.prewarmBusinessRuntime(applicationContext, "background")
  }
}
```

iOS:

```swift
import NativeComposeThreadedRuntime

ThreadedRuntime.configure(
  withReactNativeDelegate: delegate,
  launchOptions: launchOptions
)

ThreadedRuntime.prewarmBusinessRuntime("background")
```

## Shared Zustand Store

Put shared state in `@react-native-runtimes/state` so `main` and `background`
can both read and write the same data.

```tsx
import { createSharedStore } from '@react-native-runtimes/state';

type BusinessState = {
  business: BusinessSnapshot;
};

type BusinessSnapshot = {
  lastRefreshReason: string | null;
  refreshCount: number;
};

type BusinessAction = {
  type: 'refreshRequested';
  reason: string;
};

export const businessStore = createSharedStore<BusinessState, BusinessAction>({
  name: 'business',
  initialState: {
    business: {
      lastRefreshReason: null,
      refreshCount: 0,
    },
  },
  slices: {
    business: (state, action) => {
      if (action.type !== 'refreshRequested') {
        return state;
      }

      return {
        lastRefreshReason: action.reason,
        refreshCount: state.refreshCount + 1,
      };
    },
  },
  persist: {
    key: 'business-v1',
    subtrees: ['business'],
  },
});

export const business = businessStore.path<BusinessSnapshot>('business');
```

Read it from UI on the main runtime:

```tsx
function BusinessStatus() {
  const state = business.use();

  return <Text>{state.lastRefreshReason ?? 'idle'}</Text>;
}
```

## Background Functions

For work that should always run on the background runtime, define the function
in module/global scope and make `'background'` the first statement.

```tsx
async function refreshBusinessState(reason: string) {
  'background';

  await business.hydrate();
  await business.update(state => ({
    lastRefreshReason: reason,
    refreshCount: state.refreshCount + 1,
  }));

  return business.get();
}

const state = await refreshBusinessState('manual');
```

Metro rewrites that to a registered runtime function and a local scheduled
alias:

```tsx
export const refreshBusinessState_ = runtimeFunction.withId(
  'src/business.refreshBusinessState_',
  async function refreshBusinessState(reason: string) {
    'background';
    // function body
  },
);

const refreshBusinessState = call(refreshBusinessState_).on('background');
```

## Main Runtime Functions

Use `'main'` for functions that should run on the main runtime. This is useful
when background work needs to schedule a small UI-owned state update back to the
main runtime.

```tsx
async function markRefreshVisible(reason: string) {
  'main';

  await business.update(state => ({
    lastRefreshReason: reason,
    refreshCount: state.refreshCount + 1,
  }));
}

await markRefreshVisible('background-sync-complete');
```

## When To Use This Pattern

Use the two-runtime architecture when the background side has app-lifetime work:

- sync engines
- caches and hydration
- queues
- local search indexing
- document parsing
- crypto orchestration through native modules

Prefer shared Zustand state for progress and results. Avoid passing large
payloads through function arguments; pass ids or storage references instead.
Functions that use `'background'` or `'main'` must be declared at module scope,
so Metro can rewrite and register them before calls are made.

Use `ThreadedRuntime.runHeadlessTask(...)` only for native fire-and-forget jobs
that must be queued before JavaScript has a convenient caller. For normal JS
request/response work, prefer the function directive or
`call(fn).on(runtimeName)(...args)`.
